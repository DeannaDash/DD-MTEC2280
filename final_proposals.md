1.I want to create a crane game where the user uses a robot arm and a servo to 
place the arm where they want it to go and then use a button to close it and pick it up
2.I want to create a tea steeping robot arm that picks up the tea bag 
and places it in the hot water (waits 3 mins to steep) and then picks the tea bag up.
3.i want to create a mini alarm system with an arduino that only shuts off with a certain series of button presses.
